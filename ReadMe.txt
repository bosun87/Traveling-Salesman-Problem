Designed and developed an replica-based heuristic algorithm for solving the NP-hard TSP in C++

Solved optimally up to 380 cities problem with a simple 3-opt local optimization using mutual geometrical information from different replicas

Capable of coupling other more sophisticated local optimization to improve the performance
